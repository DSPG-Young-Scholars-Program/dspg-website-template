### UVA Data Science for the Public Good Program {style=text-align:center}

[The Data Science for the Public Good (DSPG) Young Scholars program](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/social-decision-analytics/dspg-program) is a summer immersive program held at the [Biocomplexity Instituteâ€™s Social and Decision Analytics division (SDAD)](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/social-decision-analytics). In its seventh year, the program engages students from across the country to work together on projects that address state, federal, and local government challenges around critical social issues relevant in the world today. DSPG young scholars conduct research at the intersection of statistics, computation, and the social sciences to determine how information generated within every community can be leveraged to improve quality of life and inform public policy. For more information on program highlights, how to apply, and our annual symposium, please visit the official [Biocomplexity DSPG website]((https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/social-decision-analytics/dspg-program)).

### Project Goals {style=text-align:center}

Example text: We're devising and assessing methods that make human populations more resilient not just during, but also before and after natural disasters. Among the topics we're studying are social isolation, social support structures, social vulnerability indices and various well-being indices.

### Our Approach {style=text-align:center}

Example text: We study damage-inducing mechanisms such as wind, rain, storm surge and flooding. We model their effects on damage to interacting networks - infrastructure and human networks. Our main priority is to understand the interactions among utility infrastructures and how they impact human life.
