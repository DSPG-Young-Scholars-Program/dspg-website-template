      <description>While this page is optional, it probably makes sense to have one weighted at the top (see the front matter at the top of this Rmd file) that gives a general overview of the project. This could be something like the final poster while the other pages highlight more in-depth observations. Here is a general schema of what should be covered throughout your website:
Framing the Problem Here you will frame the problem you encountered and how you plan to solve it.</description>

      <description>Data Science for the Public Good Program Fairfax County Project (2020)  This page will likely include the project name, project contacts, stakeholder/sponsor, team members, the project goal, a framing of the problem, and the general approach you will take to solve it. You may also mention aspects of your team, methods, and results or save that for another page.
Project Goal Example text: We&amp;rsquo;re devising and assessing methods that make human populations more resilient not just during, but also before and after natural disasters.</description>
